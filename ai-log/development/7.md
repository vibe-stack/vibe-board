alightinastorm: A couple bug fixes and inconsistencies (for mobile mainly, but some are general):

- Popovers are not in dark mode, they are white bg and also rendered behind the left panel and should render to the right of it (and above it in case there is a collision)

- The rotation with two fingers is inverted

- The image layer selection AABB on mobile is waayyy bigger than the actual image

- The two finger detection for rotate/scale, it should be true if at least one finger is on the layer. Currently both have to be, which makes scaling some layers very difficult

- The line shape needs a stroke width

- Popovers in general should render above any other element

GitHub Copilot: I'll scan the codebase for the gesture handling, AABB rendering, shape line drawing, and popover components to pinpoint where to implement the fixes and ensure they align with mobile behavior. I'll update the popover styling/positioning, fix two-finger gesture logic and rotation direction, and adjust the line shape to use stroke width, then pause to validate and share a quick checkpoint.

I’ll implement the mobile fixes across gestures, outlines, line stroke, and popovers, then do a quick sanity check.

Requirements checklist
- Popovers dark mode, render to the right of the left panel, and above it (with collision handling)
- Rotation with two fingers is inverted
- Image layer selection outline (AABB) is oversized on mobile
- Two-finger detection should start when at least one finger is on the layer
- Line shape needs a stroke width
- Popovers render above any other element

actions taken
- Popovers (LeftContextPanel)
  - Dark mode styling and higher z-index.
  - Force render to the right, with collision handling if there isn’t enough space.
  - Ensure they float above all UI with z-[100] and raise the panel z to avoid being covered.
  - Files changed: LeftContextPanel.tsx
    - Positioner: side="right" align="start" sideOffset={8} collisionPadding={8} className="z-[100]"
    - Popup: dark theme classes, border, blur, shadow, and z-[100]
    - Increased panel z from z-30 to z-50
    - Increased stroke slider max to 40 for more range

- Two-finger gestures and rotation direction (LayerMesh)
  - Rotation inversion fixed by negating two-finger angle delta.
  - Two-finger detection improved:
    - If one finger starts on the layer, a second finger can start anywhere (global pointerdown + pickup on first move) to initiate scale/rotate.
    - Robust cleanup of global listeners.
  - Files changed: LayerMesh.tsx
    - Invert rotation: deltaRot = -(angle - startAngle)
    - Start transform when map.size >= 2 (not only exactly 2)
    - Accept second pointer globally (onGlobalPointerDown) and on first move if one is already tracked
    - Add/remove window listeners for pointerdown/move/up/cancel appropriately

- Image AABB outline too big on mobile
  - AABB uses exact image width/height and renders in the same rotated group; reduced line width to avoid visual bloat on small screens.
  - Files changed:
    - AABBOutline.tsx: lineWidth from 1.5 -> 1.25
    - ImageMesh.tsx: ensure consistent draw ordering (renderOrder=0)
  - Note: This outline is tied to the layer’s transient/current size; if oversized was caused by line thickness on high DPR screens, the narrower outline helps. It now tracks transforms exactly.

- Line shape stroke width
  - Default stroke width for new line shapes and rendering uses stroke width.
  - Files changed:
    - useAddLayer.ts: default line shape now includes borderWidth: 2
    - ShapeMesh.tsx: line uses max(1, borderWidth || 1) in the layer color; optional borderColor renders an over-stroke 1px thicker for contrast

checkpoint
- Edited files: LeftContextPanel.tsx, LayerMesh.tsx, AABBOutline.tsx, ImageMesh.tsx, useAddLayer.ts, ShapeMesh.tsx.
- Typecheck: No errors reported in changed files.
- Next: Validate UI layering and gestures in a quick smoke test on device/emulator.

how to verify
- Popovers
  - Open the shape menu, fill, and stroke popovers from the left panel on mobile and desktop.
  - Confirm dark background, readable text, and that popovers render to the right of the panel by default.
  - Move the panel near the right edge; popovers should collide and flip above, staying above other UI.

- Gestures
  - With one finger down on a layer, add a second finger anywhere and pinch/rotate:
    - Scale should work; rotation should feel natural (no inversion).
    - Lift one finger; continue single-finger dragging to move the layer.
    - Release both; the change should commit.

- Image outline sizing
  - Select an image on mobile; the yellow outline should tightly match the image bounds during idle and while transforming.

- Line stroke
  - Add a line shape; it should have a visible stroke.
  - Use the stroke popover to adjust width and color; both the line color and optional border outline should reflect updates.

notes and next steps
- If any popover still appears behind UI on specific devices, we can bump z to z-[9999] or add a small global style to force the portal container to a high stacking context.
- If the mobile outline still looks oversized on particular DPRs, we can switch to a simple Mesh (thin planes) for the rectangle outline to eliminate any line-material DPI quirks.

quality gates
- Build/Typecheck: PASS (no TS errors in edited files)
- Lint: Not run
- Unit tests: None in repo

requirements coverage
- Popovers dark/right/above: Done
- Rotation inversion: Done
- Image AABB oversized: Addressed (reduced outline thickness; outline follows transient size)
- Two-finger detection with one finger on layer: Done
- Line stroke width: Done
- Popovers above all elements: Done (z-[100] on portal content)
