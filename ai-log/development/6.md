alightinastorm: Uhh, the left panel is way too big on mobile. And it's currently broken, says Rendered more hooks than during the previous render.

Use base ui (already installed), for the ui elements described below:

- The sliders should show in a popover
- The shapes should only show the current shape, on click it should also open a popover to select alternative shapes
- The shapes context setting should only be visible.. if the selected layer is a shape?

- The color pickers should be squares not rectangles (input field)

Make the left context panel slim, put things in vertical lists and actual inputs in popovers

baseui docs:
https://base-ui.com/llms.txt

GitHub Copilot: I'll scan the left context panel components and related stores to diagnose the hooks error and identify where to integrate Base UI popovers and shape/color controls, then implement the UI adjustments. I'll read the related components and stores to understand current behavior and fix the hook mismatch while implementing the requested Base UI-driven UI changes. I'll refactor the LeftContextPanel to use Base UI's Popover and Slider with stable hooks and a slimmer vertical layout, fixing the hooks error and implementing popover-based controls.

I'll fix the Tailwind class duplication errors by removing redundant outline utilities and keep consistent, valid classes.

Here’s the plan to fix and streamline the left panel on mobile:
- Fix the “Rendered more hooks than during the previous render” error.
- Make the left panel slim on mobile.
- Use Base UI popovers for sliders and inputs.
- Show only the current shape; open a popover to pick other shapes on click.
- Only show shape context when the selected layer is a shape.
- Use square color inputs (not wide rectangles).
- Keep controls in a vertical list; actual inputs live inside popovers.

actions taken
- Fixed the hooks error: previously, hooks were created after an early return when no layer was selected. Moved all hooks before the conditional return to keep the hook order consistent across renders.
- Slimmed the Left Context Panel and reorganized into a vertical icon list with popovers for editing.
- Integrated Base UI components:
  - Popovers from @base-ui-components/react/popover
  - Slider from @base-ui-components/react/slider
- Implemented shape selector:
  - Shows only the current shape icon.
  - Clicking opens a popover to choose Rect, Circle, or Line.
  - Shape chooser appears only when a shape layer is selected.
- Implemented square color pickers:
  - Fill and stroke color are square swatches within popovers.
- Moved border width control into a popover with a Base UI Slider.

files changed
- LeftContextPanel.tsx
  - Refactor to use Base UI Popover and Slider.
  - Slim vertical UI with icon triggers and popovers for actual inputs.
  - Square color swatches.
  - Fixed hook-order bug by moving hooks before the early return.
  - Only render shape context when selected layer is a shape.

notes
- Import paths for Base UI follow the docs:
  - Popover from @base-ui-components/react/popover
  - Slider from @base-ui-components/react/slider
- Removed a missing lucide-react icon and used a Square icon for stroke controls.
- Tailwind duplicate outline utility conflicts cleaned up.

how to try
- Run the dev server and open on a mobile viewport. Tap the left panel buttons:
  - If a shape is selected, the top icon shows the current shape; tap to change shape via popover.
  - Tap the paint bucket to change fill color via a square color input.
  - Tap the square border icon to open border width slider and border color square input.

quality gates
- Lint/typecheck: No compile errors reported in edited file.
- Requirements coverage:
  - Hooks error fixed: Done.
  - Slim left panel with vertical list: Done.
  - Sliders in popovers: Done.
  - Shapes show current shape; popover for alternatives: Done.
  - Show shape context only for shapes: Done.
  - Square color pickers: Done.

If you want, I can run the dev server and do a quick UX smoke test next.
