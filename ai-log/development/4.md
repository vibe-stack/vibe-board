# Tools

Task: Implement proper tool usage for the layers.
User Interactions:
- Allow users to add elements by clicking on the tools on the right
 * The image tool should open a file picker
 * Shape tool always defaults to adding a rectangle
 * Text always adds a "Text" text layer

- On the left show contextual settings for tools, e.g. for shape tool it should show different shapes to choose from
- Allow users to drag n drop images into the app and automatically insert an image layer for that
- Two fingers on a layer allow users to scale and rotate the layer
- Dragging a selected layer with one finger moves it across the canvas

State:
- All operations should happen with local state first, then once the operation finishes (commits), write to the store, so undo/redo are batched with just the commits
