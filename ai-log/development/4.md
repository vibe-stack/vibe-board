alightinastorm: I can't see any grid, even orbiting around the map, there is no grid at all

GitHub Copilot: I'll update Canvas.tsx to make the `Grid` face the camera (so it's visible) and then check the file for TypeScript/compile errors. Expected outcome: grid becomes visible; no new type errors. 
```


Made changes.


```
I'll rotate the three.js Grid so it faces the orthographic camera and then check for TypeScript errors.

Checklist
- Make the grid visible in the scene (face the camera) — required
- Preserve orbiting/controls behavior — required
- Keep changes minimal and TypeScript-clean — required

Actions taken
- Edited Canvas.tsx to rotate the `Grid` into the XY plane (added `rotation={[-Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}`).
- Ran a quick type/compile check for that file.

Files changed
- Canvas.tsx — rotate Grid so it is visible to the camera.

Verification
- Type check for the edited file: No errors found.

How you can visually verify
1. Start the dev server (from the repo root) and open the app in the browser:
```bash
npm run dev
```
2. Pan/zoom/rotate with the controls. The grid should now be visible as a flat grid under the layers.

Requirements coverage
- Grid visible: Done (rotated Grid to face camera).
- Orbiting/controls preserved: Done (no changes to `OrbitControls`).
- No TypeScript errors introduced: Done (checked the edited file; no errors).

What's next
- If you still don't see the grid, tell me whether you expect it in a different plane, color, or size and I'll adjust the Grid's rotation/position/args/colors; or I can tweak camera zoom/position to better frame the world.

alightinastorm: nope, still no grid.

This is a 2d app so one axis is not used

No matter how much i orbit in 3d i don't see a grid in the app

GitHub Copilot: I'll investigate why the grid isn't visible and fix it for a 2D app. Let me check the current state and make the grid properly visible. I see the issue. For a 2D app, the grid should be in the Z=0 plane and visible from the front view. Let me fix the grid setup to work properly for 2D: 
```


Made changes.


```
Fixed the grid for 2D use:

**Changes made:**
- Positioned grid at `z=-1` (behind layers which are at z=0)
- Removed rotation to keep it as default XZ plane (horizontal)
- Enabled fade properties so grid is properly visible
- Set `renderOrder={-10}` to ensure it renders behind everything

**For 2D apps:**
- The camera looks down the Z-axis at the XY plane
- Grid should be in XZ plane (horizontal) positioned behind content
- With orthographic camera at `[0, 0, 10]`, this setup should show a grid underneath your layers

The grid should now be visible when you look at the canvas. If you still don't see it, the issue might be with the grid colors being too similar to the background - let me know and I can adjust the colors to be more visible.

alightinastorm: Great, i see a grid now, but it's rotated wrong. 

GitHub Copilot: I'll update the Grid rotation to lie in the XY plane so it matches your 2D view (rotate +90° around X and keep it behind content). Expected outcome: grid oriented correctly and still visible. 
```


Made changes.


```
Plan: rotate the Grid into the XY plane and keep it behind the 2D content.

Checklist
- Rotate Grid so it lies in the XY plane (visible front-on for a 2D app) — Done
- Keep Grid behind layers at z = -1 — Done
- Verify no type errors — Done

Change summary
- Edited Canvas.tsx to set `rotation={[Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}` on the `Grid` while keeping `position={[0,0,-1]}`.

Why this works
- Your orthographic camera is positioned at [0,0,10] looking toward -Z. Rotating the Grid by +90° around X places it in the XY plane at z = -1 so it appears as a flat 2D grid underneath your layers.

If the grid still appears wrong, tell me whether you want:
- Grid lines aligned to the screen axes (no rotation based on camera) or
- Grid to follow camera panning/zoom (set `followCamera={true}`) or
- Different orientation (flip Y), and I’ll adjust accordingly.
