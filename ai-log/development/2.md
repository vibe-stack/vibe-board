alightinastorm: Refactor this file

Put every react component in a colocated file

GitHub Copilot: I'll split the large `Canvas.tsx` into colocated component files and update `Canvas.tsx` to import them; the patch will add new component files and modify `Canvas.tsx` accordingly. Expected outcome: same runtime behavior but each React component lives in its own file under components.

Now I'll apply the code changes.

Task: Refactor Canvas.tsx so each React component is colocated in its own file; I'll split components into separate files and update imports.

Checklist
- Move ImageMesh into ImageMesh.tsx — Done
- Move TextMesh into TextMesh.tsx — Done
- Move ShapeMesh into ShapeMesh.tsx — Done
- Move AABBOutline into AABBOutline.tsx — Done
- Move LayerMesh into LayerMesh.tsx — Done
- Update Canvas.tsx to import and use the new component files — Done
- Run a basic static error check — Done (no errors found)

Files added
- ImageMesh.tsx — Image rendering mesh component.
- TextMesh.tsx — Text rendering mesh component.
- ShapeMesh.tsx — Shape (rect/circle/line) mesh component.
- AABBOutline.tsx — Draws selection outline.
- LayerMesh.tsx — Pointer/gesture handling and composes the above.

Files changed
- Canvas.tsx — imports `LayerMesh` and simplified to compose the scene.

Progress & verification
- I applied the refactor and ran a static error check across the edited files; no TypeScript/JSX errors were reported.
- I preserved original behavior and logic; the gesture/pointer logic and store usage remain unchanged but are now in `LayerMesh.tsx`.

What's next (optional)
- Run the dev server (npm run dev) and manually test touch/gesture interactions and selection to confirm runtime behavior.
- Add unit tests for gesture logic or tiny smoke integration tests if you want automated verification.
- Move other related helpers or types to a `components/shared` folder if you plan further decomposition.

If you'd like, I can:
- Run the dev server now and report runtime console output.
- Add brief README notes in components describing each file.
- Extract common types or utils used across the new files.
